This project is a simulation of a shopping website, and a rewarding system for the external clients and employees.
Whenever someone spends more than 100 currency, they get 10 loyalty points.
Each account has a level, from 0-4.
Each level gives you a certain discount for shoppings more than 500 currency:
  Lv. 0: nothing
  Lv. 1: 5 currency discount.
  Lv. 2: 10 currency discount.
  Lv. 3: 15 currency discount.
  Lv. 4: 20 currency discount.

Whenever an external account levels up they get a random prize.
The project also simulates an authentication system that only uses email.
